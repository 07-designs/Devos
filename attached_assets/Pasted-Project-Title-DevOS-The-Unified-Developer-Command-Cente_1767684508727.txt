Project Title: DevOS - The Unified Developer Command Center

Role: You are an Expert Full-Stack Architect and Engineer.

Goal: Build a production-ready, highly responsive web application called "DevOS". This is a "One-Stop Platform" for developers to manage their coding profiles, development tools, and cloud resources in a single dashboard.

Tech Stack Requirements:
- Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (with Shadcn/UI components for a premium look)
- Backend: Next.js Server Actions & API Routes
- Database: PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM)
- Authentication: NextAuth.js (Auth.js) - Google & GitHub Providers
- AI Integration: Google Gemini API (Google Generative AI SDK)
- Icons: Lucide-React

Core Features & Architecture:

1. The "Command Center" (Dashboard):
   - A grid-based layout displaying "Widgets" for different platforms.
   - Section 1: Competitive Programming (LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder).
   - Section 2: Version Control (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
   - Section 3: Data Science & Cloud (Kaggle, Google Colab, Azure, AWS).
   - Functionality: Each widget should display a "Connect" button (to input username/API key) and once connected, show a summary of stats (e.g., LeetCode ranking, GitHub contributions graph mockup, etc.).
   - "Quick Link" Action: Clicking the widget title opens the respective platform in a new tab (simulating the "Go to" feature).

2. The "Brutal Reality" AI Coach (Gemini Integration):
   - Create a dedicated page or modal called "The Mirror".
   - Logic: Aggregates the user's stats from the connected widgets (e.g., "Solved 50 easy problems", "No GitHub commits in 3 days").
   - AI Persona: The AI must be a "Ruthless Senior Engineer/Career Coach". It should not be nice. It should critique the user's low activity, identify gaps in their stack, and give a "Brutal Reality Check" on their placement chances.
   - Output: A generated Markdown roadmap for the next 30 days based on their weak areas.

3. Profile & Settings Management:
   - A settings page to store Usernames and API Keys for the external services locally in the DB or secure storage.

4. UI/UX Design System:
   - Theme: "Cyberpunk / Hacker" aesthetic. Dark mode by default.
   - Font: Geist Mono or a similar clean monospace font for that "developer" feel.
   - Components: Use Cards, Progress bars, and Badges from Shadcn.

Step-by-Step Implementation Guide for you:
1. Setup the Next.js project with the specified stack.
2. Create the Prisma schema to store User, Accounts, and PlatformStats.
3. Build the Dashboard UI with placeholder widgets first.
4. Implement the "Brutal AI" Server Action:
   - Input: User's stat JSON.
   - Prompt to Gemini: "Analyze these coding stats. Be brutally honest. Tell the user why they are failing or succeeding. Create a study plan."
5. Implement the connections: For V1, use public APIs (like LeetCode's graphql or GitHub's REST API) to fetch basic real data if possible, otherwise simulate data fetching structure for the user to fill in.

Constraint: Ensure the code is modular so new platforms can be added easily.
